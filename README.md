## ✨ Description

**ArenaKu** allows users to browse available sports venues, view real-time schedules, and book fields online.  
It’s designed with scalability in mind — initially for one owner (me), but the database structure already supports **multi-owner functionality** in the future.

The main goal of this project is to **learn and apply modern web development practices** using Next.js and TypeScript while simulating a realistic SaaS-like platform architecture.
